It's build entirely on HTML and CSS, without any external library. It's a responsive website, using mainly 
flexbox for the distribution of elements, relative and absolute position for the floating images, 
and respecting the fonts and color palette of the original template. The images are either of the 
template or from pexels. 

This project is a clone website of: https://nicepage.com/t/23269/travel-app-template
